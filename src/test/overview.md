# Site feature overview

## Site purpose

EA Donation Swap lets users *offer* to donate a certain amount of money, and they are then *matched* with others, in order to maximize each others tax benefits.

Usually, someone from a country with many approved charities will offer funds to donate, and then someone from a country with only a few such  approved charities will be matched with them. It is also possible to have a mutually beneficial swap in certain cases.

I am creating a list of tests that would be nice to have. These will start as manual tests, but some will be easy to make into unit tests.
